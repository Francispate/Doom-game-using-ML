## Features
- Real-time advice based on gameplay data
- Radar and visual HUD support
- Rule-based fallback logic
- Multi-agent simulation (seeker/hider)
- Model training and logging system

## Files
- `assistant.py` – Assistant logic
- `ml_logger.py` – Gameplay data logger
- `train_assistant_model.py` – ML training script
- `assistant_model.joblib` – Trained model
- `assistant_logs.csv` – Logged data

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. Run `main.py`
3. Press `M` to activate the assistant

## License
